Abstract

   Recent events have caused concern about control of access to the
   Internet, leading one infrastructure company's CEO to reportedly
   assert:

      Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn't
      be allowed on the Internet.  No one should have that power.

   In fact, the Internet is both architected and administered to
   preclude any one entity from having this power, through the careful
   management of "choke points" where such power could be exercised.

1.  Choke Points on the Internet

   A large influence on the architecture of the Internet was a need to
   survive nuclear attack [1], so that loss of no one link or node would
   preclude communication.  This extends not only to the physical links
   that make up the Internet (seen, for example, in the duplication of
   submarine internet links [2]), but also to the various services that
   Internet access depends upon; for example, the operation of multiple
   DNS root servers [3].

   Avoiding choke points is both a design goal for both the protocols
   and the services that make network access and operations possible, as
   well as an assumption made by each layer and service about its
   dependencies.  The resilience of the Internet depends on this
   assumption.

   This design goal extends to the entities that operate the Internet.
   For example, not only are there multiple DNS root servers, but we
   also assure that they are operated by a number of parties, many of
   which compete against each other.

   However, there are some cases when there is an unavoidable choke
   point.  For example, as a central source of truth regarding naming,
   administration of the name space within the Domain Name System is a
   necessary choke point.

   When an Internet choke point can't be avoided, we assure that it is
   administered by multiple parties with balanced interests, often
   referred to as the Multi-Stakeholder Model [4].  In the case of the
   Domain Name System, oversight is performed by ICANN.

   Similarly, the specifications that describe the Internet and the Web
   form another potential choke point, since they mediate how most
   people use the Internet.  For these, standardization is overseen by

   the World Wide Web consortium and the IETF, both of whom subscribe to
   open standards principles [5].

   Together, these architectural principles and corresponding practices
   assure that no one person, business or government can control the
   entire Internet.

2.  Emerging Choke Points

   In some cases, external factors encourage the formation of a new
   choke point despite the efforts outlined above.  For example, near-
   monopolies on "last-mile" Internet access in some jurisdictions have
   led to concerns about network neutrality [6], since they act as a
   choke point.

   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are sometimes viewed as another
   emerging choke point, because they are seen as essential in
   mitigating Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.  While there
   appears to be a healthy market of CDNs (and similar services) and the
   costs of using one have been driven down considerably over the years,
   current reliance on them suggests that there is a risk of a choke
   point forming - as there is wherever a function is critical to the
   Internet's operation.

   When such a choke point forms, one possible way to counter its ill
   effects is regulation, either externally or within the Internet
   ecosystem (e.g., as ICANN does).  While it may be appropriate as a
   solution - especially when a monopoly forms - the effect of
   regulation on the architecture need to be evaluated carefully.

   Historically, the Internet has worked best as a network-of-networks,
   where each has administrative control to make decisions about who is
   allowed to connect locally.  Imposing external constraints on how
   networks select their members and who they communicate with could
   have far-reaching effects, especially since they are often already
   subject to a variety of local laws and regulations.

   Ensuring that choke points don't form is preferable to enshrining
   them, since they introduce not only points of control, but also
   increase the risk of failure in that component, concentrate the risk
   of security vulnerabilities there, and can ultimately limit the scale
   of the Internet.

   Therefore, when there is risk of a choke point forming, we look for
   other mitigations before considering constraints on the behaviour of
   infrastructure providers.  This might take place through encouraging
   more diversity at the potential choke point, technical measures that
   counteract its formation, or other means.

   Going back to the example of CDNs and DDoS mitigation, the IETF is
   working to create protocols to help networks to communicate about
   DDoS attacks in the DOTS Working Group, and there is emerging work to
   help networks prevent their clients from contributing to DDoS
   attacks.

   Outside the IETF, organisations like FIRST assure that responses are
   coordinated.  These approaches aim to find a cooperative and
   voluntary solution to the problem without necessitating a new choke
   point.

3.  Avoid Choke Points

   As John Gilmore said, "the internet interprets censorship as damage
   and routes around it."  Censorship is a form of control that relies
   on having an opportunity to exercise control.  Limiting the number of
   choke points and assuring that any unavoidable points are
   appropriately administered allows this valuable architectural
   property to persist.

   At the same time, the Internet's composition as a network of
   independent networks is valuable; imposing external controls on them
   is to be avoided.  However, this does not mean that internet
   infrastructure providers are without guidance; we note that the UN's
   Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [7] is an already-
   existing framework for businesses (including Internet infrastructure
   providers) to make such decisions within while still respecting human
   rights - including the right to Internet access.
